A **symmetry operation** describes a transformation of a **configuration space** that leaves it indistinguishable. Each **symmetry operation** can be describes as a matrix that maps the vectors in a **configuration space** onto each other, e.g. in the case of the equiateral triangle the simplest **symmetry operation** is the identity, $E$, which leaves every corner unchanged, and can be represented by the matrix \n",
