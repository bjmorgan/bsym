Introduction
============

``bsym`` is a basic Python symmetry module. It consists of core
classes that describe configuration vector spaces, their symmetry
operations, and specific configurations of objects within these spaces.

The module also contains an interface for working with
`pymatgen <http://pymatgen.org>`__ ``Structure`` objects, to allow
simple generation of disordered symmetry-inequivalent structures from a
symmetric parent crystal structure.

Source code is available as a git repository at https://github.com/bjmorgan/bsym.
