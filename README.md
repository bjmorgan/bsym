# symmetry

This library has been written to identify symmetry inequivalent arrangements of objects on a periodic 2D lattice.
It's intended application is for enumeration of atom configurations on crystalline surfaces.
An example application is described in [this publication][LTO surfaces paper].

The initial version was written by [Benjamin J. Morgan][my site] in 2014.

Source code is available as a git repository at [https://github.com/bjmorgan/symmetry][github]

# introduction

A simple example of this code if provided in `./examples/first_example.py`. This enumerates the possible ways to occupy two sites (out of four) on a square 2x2 lattice.

Sites in a square lattice can be represented by numerical labels:
 
      - -
    | 1 2 |
    | 3 4 |
      - -

The script first constructs the "space group" by reading a file containing all relevant symmetry operations.

    spacegroup_filename = '../spacegroups/cubic_spacegroup_annotated'
    sg = sym.SpaceGroup.read_from_file( spacegroup_filename )

This file contains a list of integer vectors. Each entry describes the mapping from the current site (given by its position in the vector) to the equivalent site under this operation.
e.g.

- the identity keeps all sites unchanged: `1 2 3 4`
- a 90 degree rotation clockwise maps 1 -> 2, 2 -> 4, 4 -> 3, and 3 -> 1, and is encoded as `2 4 1 3`.
- a translation by half the cell to the right maps 1 -> 2, 2 -> 1, 3 -> 4, and 4 -> 3, and is encoded as `2 1 4 3`.

We then define the distribution of different sites, e.g. for 2 occupied and 2 unoccupied sites:

    site_dist = { 1 : 2, 
                  0 : 2 }
                  
 with each entry in the dictionary `label : number`. Here we define two sites will have occupation label `1` and 2 will have occupation label `2`.
 
 The unique configurations are generated by
 
     unique_configurations = sym.process.unique_configurations_from_sites( site_dist, sg, verbose=True )
     
 A clean print of the occupation vectors for the results is generated with:
 
 [ config.pprint() for config in unique_configurations ] 
 
 In this case we get:
 
     1 1 0 0
     1 0 0 1
     
 (or equivalent), which represent adjacent and diagonal occupation patterns:
 
      - -        - -
    | 1 1 |    | 1 0 |
    | 0 0 |    | 0 1 |
      - -        - -
